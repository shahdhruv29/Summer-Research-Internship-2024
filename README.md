## Topic: Multiple Imputation To Handle Missing Data

## Mentor: Prof. Tathagata Bandyopadhyay

During the summer of 2024, I had the opportunity to study techniques used to Handle Missing Data. The primary focus was to learn about state-of-the-art techniques, such as the Expectation Maximization (EM) Algorithm and the Multiple Imputation Technique to handle the problem of missing values in datasets, as given by Schafer and Graham [1]. I also implemented these methods using the R Programming Language.
